# 101pong

3D geometry and trigonometry.

Project for semester 1 of the Epitech Math module.

### Description

This is done in the context of the game of pong, we understand the paddle is the plane Z.Given 2 positions of the ball calculate its velocity vector and where will the ball be in some seconds. Detect if its going to collide with the paddle and if so calculate the incidence angle.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Python3](https://python.org/)

### Installation

* Download/Clone the repository and enter its directory
* Now you are ready to run the code

## Usage
- **Execution** `./101pong x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 n`

### Arguments
